Abstract: Wraps the CAEAGLLayer from CoreAnimation into a convenient 
          UIView subclass. The view content is an EAGL surface used 
		  to render the OpenGL scene (the captured video frames and 
		  colored sprite). The animation of the colored sprite 
		  is performed using a CADisplayLink.
